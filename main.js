// jumbotron with background video play on land like codecademy intensives. name/logo/profile pic opacity and movement animation, probably slight movement upwards. after get basics down, try to implement the react to mouse thing where it moves slightly in reaction to mouse movement. might be able to do that with vanilla JS, whichever makes more sense. not sure what to put after jumbotron, maybe projects i've made.

// emmett, hot reload enabled. react extension get if necessary
